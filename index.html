					<h2><a href="https://github.com/1998gsg/Synthetic-Data-Project">Comparative analysis and Evaluation
							of techniques for Generating High-Quality
							synthetic data for Industrial Control Systems datasets.<br />
						</a></h2>
					<p>This research focuses on generating high-quality synthetic data for Industrial Control Systems
						(ICS) datasets and proposes an evaluation framework for selecting the most suitable method. The
						aim is to create realistic and diverse datasets while preserving privacy and addressing biases.
						The comparative analysis reveals strengths, limitations, and trade-offs of different synthetic
						data generation techniques for ICS datasets. The findings aid in selecting appropriate methods,
						enabling further research and algorithm development in a privacy-preserving environment. This
						research contributes to advancing ICS understanding, enhancing capabilities, and improving the
						robustness and security of ICS systems.<br />

					<p>The aim of this study is to determine a method for understanding ensemble models through
						visual analytics. The method is used to identify and quantify the confidence levels
						between the models that constitute the ensemble. This is done using an interactive
						dashboard with visualizations to check the agreement and disagreement of the model's
						prediction in comparison with the true class. Evaluation of the project is performed with
						visualization as the core aspect of the user study. Scenarios are chosen with appropriate
						questions and goals and evaluated based on the results.

					<p>In the era of online shopping and a wide range of products available, determining product
						quality is time-consuming. User reviews on platforms like Amazon and blogs are crucial for
						improving customer experiences. This project aims to analyze user reviews by
						building a model that assesses the worthiness of suggested products. The application
						gathers data from various sources, calculates aggregate sentiment, and allows users
						to compare multiple products. By employing natural language processing techniques, we can
						determine customer mood and trends, aiding in efficient user review analysis. This
						solution benefits both customers and product owners, enhancing decision-making and
						business growth.</p>

					<p>In this project, we aim to support beginner investors by effectively predicting stock
						values and trends. By analyzing historical data, we will develop a model to predict
						the closing prices of stocks. This will benefit new investors, including recent graduates,
						in making informed investment decisions and reducing the risk of failed investments.
						Our model will also provide visual representations of the data, aiding in data
						interpretation. The ultimate goal is to empower investors with accurate predictions
						and visual insights, ensuring their success in the stock market.</p>

						<h2><a href="https://github.com/1998gsg/Sleep-Apnea">Detection of Obstructive Sleep Apnea

					<a href="https://github.com/1998gsg/Sleep-Apnea/blob/main/Detection%20of%20OSA.pdf"
						class="image fit"><img src="images/Sleep.JPG" alt="" /></a>
					<p>The proposed design model focuses on age variants and face landmark variations to detect
						Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Facial photographs are collected from subjects at
						different
						lightings, and a MATLAB model is developed using deep learning neural networks. Key
						features
						related to OSA, such as distances between eyes, nose, and cheek, are extracted using
						a
						convolutional neural network. The model predicts the presence of OSA in patients based on
						these
						features, achieving high accuracy, precision, and recall rates.

					<p>Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET) is a famous and special kind of wireless
						mobile ad hoc network. It is ad-hoc network where each network node acts an independent and
						self-organized network. In VANET various routing protocols have
						been proposed and used and they are of high importance for desirable VANET applications. In this
						project we plan to propose an improved routing algorithm to
						facilitate faster communication between clusters. The simulation results of position
						based routing protocols are discussed in terms of packet delivery ratio and through put metrics.
